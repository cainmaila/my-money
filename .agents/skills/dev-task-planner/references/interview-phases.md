# Interview Phases Reference

## Not Applicable Rules

A phase is **N/A** if either condition is true:

1. **Spec already answers it** — the requirements document explicitly states the decision. Pre-fill the decision log from the spec; do not ask.
2. **System doesn't need it** — the phase is structurally irrelevant (e.g., Phase 5 Auth for a CLI tool with no user login; Phase 6 Integrations for a self-contained local script; Phase 2 Frontend for a pure API service).

Mark the phase as `N/A` in the decision log with a one-line reason. Treat N/A phases as "resolved" for the purposes of the completion signal. Do not ask questions about N/A phases.

## Phase Checklist

Work through phases in order. Mark N/A (see rules above) rather than asking unnecessary questions.

### Phase 1: Runtime & Language

Questions to resolve:

- What programming language(s)?
- What language version constraints?
- Monorepo or separate repos?

### Phase 2: Framework & Libraries

Questions to resolve:

- Backend framework (if applicable)?
- Frontend framework (if applicable)?
- Any mandatory libraries or SDKs?
- Any libraries explicitly forbidden?

### Phase 3: Data Layer

Questions to resolve:

- Database type (relational / document / key-value / time-series)?
- Specific database product?
- ORM or raw queries?
- Migration strategy (schema-first or code-first)?
- Caching layer needed?

### Phase 4: Infrastructure & Deployment

Questions to resolve:

- Where does this run? (local / VPS / cloud provider / container platform)
- Containerized? (Docker, Kubernetes?)
- CI/CD pipeline requirements?
- Environments needed? (dev / staging / prod)

### Phase 5: Auth & Security

Questions to resolve:

- Authentication method? (session, JWT, OAuth2, SSO, none)
- Authorization model? (RBAC, ABAC, flat, none)
- Any compliance requirements? (GDPR, HIPAA, PCI, etc.)
- Any security-mandated tooling that must be used? (e.g., specific IdP, KMS, secret manager, audit logging service, WAF)

### Phase 6: Integrations & External APIs

Questions to resolve:

- Any third-party services to integrate?
- Are API keys/credentials already available or to be provisioned?
- Any webhooks? If yes: inbound (external → this system), outbound (this system → external), or both?

### Phase 7: Non-Functional Requirements

Questions to resolve:

- Expected concurrent users or request volume?
- Response time targets?
- Availability SLA?
- Observability requirements? (logging, metrics, tracing)

### Phase 8: Team & Dev Constraints

Questions to resolve:

- Team size and roles?
- Any deadline (time constraints)?
- Any budget constraints? (e.g., cloud spend cap, licensing limits)
- How many developers are expected to work in parallel on this project?
- Preferred split strategy for parallel work? (by layer, by domain, by user journey, or no preference)
- Existing codebase to integrate with?
- Any technologies forbidden at any layer (database engines, cloud platforms, deployment methods, vendors)? (Libraries are covered in Phase 2 — this phase catches everything else.)
- Any must-use technologies mandated by the business or organization (beyond libraries)?
- Which contracts or boundaries should be frozen first so multiple developers can work independently? (e.g., API schema, DB migration plan, event payloads, shared component props)
- Are mocks/stubs acceptable so dependent tasks can proceed before the real implementation is finished?
- Any required integration checkpoints or merge milestones? (e.g., daily contract sync, end-of-sprint integration branch)

## Decision Log Format

Every field in this log maps to a named field in the SPEC.md template. No field is orphaned. Maintain in conversation after each answer.

**SPEC mapping key** — shown as `→ SPEC §section.field` on each line below.

### Open Questions
- [question]: unresolved
```

**Merge rules for SPEC §5:**

- `Must-use tech` = Phase 2 must-use libraries + Phase 5 must-use tech (security) + Phase 8 must-use tech (business), deduplicated
- `Forbidden tech` = Phase 2 forbidden libraries + Phase 8 forbidden tech (any layer), deduplicated

**Rules:**

- Every field must have a value or explicit `N/A` / `none` / `not specified` before tasks are generated.
- "Open Questions" must be empty at completion.
- Fields pre-filled from the spec are still recorded — mark them `(from spec)`.

## Contradiction Detection Checklist

After every answer, scan for these contradiction patterns:

| Pattern                                | Example                                           |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Tech A incompatible with Tech B        | "Serverless" + "WebSocket persistent connections" |
| Constraint conflicts with scale        | "Solo dev" + "99.99% SLA"                         |
| Framework conflicts with language      | PHP framework + Python language                   |
| DB choice conflicts with data shape    | Relational DB + "flexible schema"                 |
| Auth method conflicts with integration | "No server" + "Session-based auth"                |
| Deadline conflicts with scope          | "2 weeks" + 40 tasks                              |

When a contradiction is found, surface it:

> "I noticed a possible contradiction: you chose [A], but also mentioned [B], which may conflict because [reason]. How would you like to resolve this?"

Do not proceed to the next question until the contradiction is resolved.

---

## Completion Signal

Interview is complete when:

- Every decision log field has a value, `N/A`, `none`, or `not specified` — no blanks
- "Open Questions" section is empty
- No unresolved contradictions
- Scope Validation (Workflow Phase 2) is done

Final confirmation message — adapt to user's language:

> ZH: "All technical decisions confirmed, no contradictions. MVP scope: [summary]. Ready to decompose development tasks."
> EN: "All technical decisions confirmed, no contradictions. MVP scope: [summary]. Ready to generate tasks."

Then proceed to ask for output path (Workflow Phase 3).
